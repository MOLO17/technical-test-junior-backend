# M17 technical test project starter

This is a started project to help you build your own solution for the technical test.
If you're missing the test requirements or you need some more clarifications (functional or technical), please don't hesitate to contact your M17 reference or send an email to web@molo17.com.

## Programming language

We chose **Typescript** because it's the main language used in our projects. This doesn't mean that we don't accept technical tests written in other languages, feel free to use whatever you feel more comfortable with.

If you do, however, chose to use Typescript we got everything set up to get you started.

## Database

In this project, you will find two basics [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) files that can be used to run [MongoDB](mongodb-docker-compose.yml) or [MySQL](mysql-docker-compose.yml).
You can however use another database of your choice or even use a cloud solution (we suggest [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) as it gives you a free 512MB sandbox to play with and no credit card is needed).

## Dependencies

- **Node.js** > 12.x;
- **Visual Studio Code** (optional);
- **Docker** (optional);
- **Yarn** (optional).

## Setup and configuration

- Run `npm install` or `yarn`;
- If you chose to use docker:
  `docker-compose -f {mysql | mongodb}-docker-compose.yml up`;
- If you use vscode as your editor we added some extensions suggestion, install
  them by clicking on the dialog when prompted (usually at startup);
- Run development server `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Last but not least

Feel free to change anything in this project or just start it from scratch.
And most importantly, we hope you have fun!
